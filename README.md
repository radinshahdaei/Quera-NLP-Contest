# Text Processing Contest

This repository contains the questions and notebooks from the online text processing selection contest hosted by Quera. We implemented a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests Regressors and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to tackle the tasks.
